In a far away kingdom
of undescribable beauty
there lived a group of creatures
with wonderful powers

The humos, they were called
always dancing backwards
but something was wrong
for they never stopped thier 
feast to control the climate
dancing, singing and playing...

But, evil colitas
full of envy
took their little hands
and locked them up
now the humos cry
who can save us?

Oh great wizard of ink
stop wandering and
free the little hands
so they can dance
and let them return to the kingdom
that has been destroyed
without the help of these criatures
that controlled the climate.
